# Constituent Donor Database Cleanup
Consulting work for a major environmental nonprofit
Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy
Experience gained: Exercise in cleaning messy, real-world, user-entered data

As a data consultant for an environmental nonprofit, I was tasked with cleaning a large and extremely messy database of 27,000 constituent records.

I used Python to programmatically explore the data and clean the records using functions whenever possible.

There were many edge cases that didn't fit any clear function definitions and had to be handled manually.
